## About the project
Cooking has always been a passion of mine, a way to decompress from a stressful day at work, a reward for a difficult or tenuous task successfully completed, a way to bring people together and a way of communication. The idea of creating a food blog has been on my mind for years. When people around me kept telling me they loved my dishes and all the little tips that came with them I finally decided it was time to go ahead and create The Travelling Wooden Spoon.

The Travelling Wooden Spoon is a dynamic blog application focused on recipes, weekly cooking tips, and engaging user interactions. Users can browse recipes, view blog posts, create an account in order to rate recipes or leave comments, read weekly tips, and sign up for a weekly newsletter to stay up to date. 

The application supports a rich feature set, including user authentication, newsletter subscriptions, and automated blog updates when new recipes are published.

Admins can manage the content through the Django Admin Panel, utilizing tools like Summernote for styling their posts making them truly individual. They will love the history panel, that allows them to keep track of their post history, the scheduling section for creating and queueing posts in advance, then schedule them for future release and the option to export an up-to-date list of subscribers in CSV-format for mailings.

The Travelling Wooden Spoon is a feature-rich platform for recipe enthusiasts. Its robust backend ensures seamless content management, while the frontend delivers a user-friendly experience. With the bugs resolved and planned enhancements, the project is well-positioned for growth and engagement.

## Color Palette

The color palettes, dark earthy tones, are used throughout the project. The earth in which vegetables grow is auburn, the plants that grow fruits are green and color of the kitchen staff is white. The colors stand in a wonderful contrast to the bright and colourful images of the dishes. The clear message here is that cooking is fun, satisfying and rewarding. Food brings us together, food is a topic everyone has something to say about. A good meal lifts our spirit and the colours chosen, together with the overall layout of the page, invite the user to stick around and explore.

# Security Features and Error Handling

## Security Features

Security is a critical aspect of the project, ensuring **data integrity, user protection, and system resilience** against malicious attacks. Security and error handling are **top priorities** for the project, ensuring a **secure, reliable, and user-friendly experience**. By enforcing **defensive coding practices, input validation, secure authentication, data encryption, and role-based access control**, we mitigate risks and protect both users and administrators. Error handling mechanisms further **improve stability and usability**, allowing the system to recover gracefully from unexpected failures.

The following defensive coding techniques and security measures are implemented across the project:

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Django's built-in authentication system** is used to enforce user authentication.
- Role-based access control (**RBAC**) differentiates **normal users, staff, and superusers** to limit permissions accordingly.
- **Session expiration & inactivity logout** prevent unauthorized access if a session remains idle for too long.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** can be integrated for additional security.

### **User Management & Account Security**
- **Password hashing using Django‚Äôs PBKDF2 algorithm** (configurable with bcrypt, Argon2, or SHA-256) to secure stored credentials.
- **Brute-force protection** via login attempt throttling to prevent repeated unauthorized login attempts.
- Users must use **strong passwords**, enforced through Django‚Äôs built-in **password validators**.
- **Email verification** is required for new account activation and password resets.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection** is enabled for all sensitive user actions.

### **Data Protection & Input Validation**
- **Form validation** prevents SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and malicious inputs.
- All input fields are sanitized before being stored in the database.
- **Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is used instead of raw SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **File uploads are restricted** to specific formats, and **size limits** are set to prevent abuse.
- **Sensitive data is encrypted** before being stored, using Django‚Äôs **encrypted fields** or third-party libraries like **Fernet encryption**.

### **API Security**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 authentication** for API endpoints.
- API rate limiting using **Django Rest Framework‚Äôs (DRF) throttling** to prevent abuse.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions** are applied to prevent unauthorized API access.
- **Input validation and serialization** ensure only properly formatted data is processed.

### **Admin Panel Security**
- **Admin panel access is restricted** to superusers and staff members.
- **Recent admin actions are logged**, allowing audits for tracking changes.
- **Bulk actions (delete, approve, mark verified)** require confirmation to prevent unintended modifications.
- **Only verified email addresses** can be assigned as primary to prevent account impersonation.
- **Superusers receive notifications for suspicious activity** within the admin panel.

### **Content Moderation & Spam Prevention**
- **Comment moderation system** allows administrators to approve or disapprove user comments before publishing.
- **Honeypot techniques & reCAPTCHA** are used on forms to prevent bot submissions.
- **Email verification** prevents spam accounts from engaging in malicious activities.

### **Database Integrity Protection**
- **Foreign key constraints** ensure related data is properly linked and prevent orphan records.
- **Transactional integrity** is enforced using Django‚Äôs **atomic transactions** to prevent partial data updates in case of failure.
- **Backups & automatic rollbacks** are scheduled to recover from accidental data loss or corruption.

### **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Django‚Äôs logging framework** is configured to track authentication attempts, errors, and suspicious activity.
- **Error logs are monitored in real-time**, and alerts are triggered for repeated failed login attempts or unusual API usage.
- **Third-party security monitoring tools**, such as Sentry, can be integrated to capture and analyze security breaches.

---

## Error Handling

A **robust error-handling mechanism** is in place to **prevent crashes, improve usability, and log critical failures**.

### **Form & Input Validation Errors**
- User input validation provides **real-time feedback** to prevent incorrect submissions.
- Custom **error messages** guide users toward resolving input issues.
- **Try-except blocks** handle unexpected form errors gracefully.

### **Authentication & Access Errors**
- Unauthorized users attempting to access restricted pages are **redirected to the login page with an error message**.
- **403 Forbidden and 401 Unauthorized responses** are properly returned in the API when access is denied.
- **Invalid login attempts are logged**, and users are notified of suspicious login activity.

### **Database & Model Errors**
- **Atomic transactions** prevent database corruption by rolling back failed operations.
- **Custom error handlers** catch and display meaningful error messages when database operations fail.
- **Graceful handling of missing database records**, preventing "DoesNotExist" exceptions.

### **Server & Application Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error pages** are customized to provide helpful debugging information for admins.
- **404 Not Found pages** ensure missing routes or content do not break the application.
- **Graceful degradation** is implemented to prevent complete system failure if one component goes down.

### **API & External Service Errors**
- **Timeout handling** ensures third-party API failures do not crash the application.
- **Retries and fallbacks** are used for essential external requests.
- **Descriptive API error responses** guide developers in debugging failed requests.

# Testing

### Initial Checks

To catch and be able to reverse an action before being forced to wipe the database I made sure to strictly following the concept of model first and test the functionality with print statements to the terminal before creating the template accordingling.

I confirmed that all errors caused by user action are handeled the expected way and the corresponding feedback messages are given to the user by entering invalid inputs:

- Submit button hit in forms before filling out all fields
- inputs not matching the expected format
- attempting to submit a comment twice, either by error or intentionally
- signing up for the newsletter twice, either by error or intentionally
- trying to submit more than one rating
- attempting to submit a rating or commment when not signed in

I had content reviewed by test users so I catch and fix typos and/or grammar errors.

I thoroughly tested all buttons, carousel and scroll-down-icon on both mobile devices, tablets and desktop.

Together with my test users (age 25 - 74) I reviewed the content on different devices to ensure all of the content is displayed as expected.

### Bugs and Resolutions


1. **TemplateDoesNotExist Error**
    - **Issue:** Template paths were not correctly defined, causing Django to throw errors.
    - **Solution:** Adjusted the app's TEMPLATES setting and ensured proper folder structures.


2. **BlogPost and Recipe Description Compatibility**
    - **Issue:** Recipes created before fixing integration issue of Summernote didn't display descriptions properly afterwards
    - **Solution:** Backfilled missing excerpt and description data using Django Shell.


3. **Comment Deletion by Users**
    - **Issue:** When reviewing the User Stories created I noticed that I had forgotten to add a Delete-button resulting in Users being unable to delete their own comments.
    - **Solution:** Added delete_comment view and corresponding button in the recipe_detail.html.

    
4. **Truncated Text in Templates**
    - **Issue:** Long descriptions cluttered the index.html and category.html due to same field being used in recipe_detail.html
    - **Solution:** Tried to add methods (truncated_description, truncated_snippet) to models and updated templates. When that kept causing cascading errors I added a new field named "excerpt" to the recipe model which now gives the user the option to additionally add an attention-catching hook for displaying the recipe on home page and category page.


5. **Missing Admin Filters**
    - **Issue:** Dynamic Summernote integration removed admin filters.
    - **Solution:** Reinstated filters in admin.py for key models.


6. **Weekly Tip Page Newsletter**
    - **Issue:** Newsletter functionality was missing.
    - **Solution:** Implemented a newsletter form, added validation, and integrated backend management.


7. **Blog Detail View**
    - **Issue:** blog_detail needed to reuse recipe_detail.html to avoid having to create another template after amending the Blogpost model to fix the problem of new posts added not automatically being displayed in Latest-Blogpost-Section on Homepage
    - **Solution:** Updated the blog_detail view to pass relevant data dynamically.



### Remaining Bugs:

-> no known bugs remaining; all parts of the application worked as expected during manual testing


### Validator Testing:

W3C CSS: no errors detected (no option to create URL link to paste here)
W3C HTML: multiple errros returned across all files caused by Django templating language
JSHint: no errors detected

### Automated Testing

- PEP8
    - installed and ran .flake8 to get a list of linter violations
    - installed an ran autopep8
  => all issues but one issue (too many characters in line) fixed => fixing that error led to function stopping to work 

- Automated Testing in Django:
  -> created a test folder for each app and a test- file for each .py-file

  blog app:
  -> 1 import error (redirect missing) fixed
  -> one error in calculating average rating fixed -> float() added for a more precise result
  -> repeated error in test_signal.py due to test environmentv not able to reproduce signal

  froms.py
  -> no errors detected

  about.py:
  -> repeated error caused by link to cloudinary due to sample picture stored locally -> test function in test_about_page_context refactored _. error remains

  weekly_tips.py: 
  -> repeated error that file could not be detected

  troubleshooting; debugging with 
  -> python manage.py test weekly_tip --verbosity 
  -> python -m unittest discover weekly_tip/tests
  -> python manage.py test weekly_tip.tests.test_models
  -> ran python manage.py test --verbosity 3 --failfast -> grabbed all files and returned only the errors known and described above
